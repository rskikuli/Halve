I'm writting this blog post from Donostia-San Sebastian (Basque Country) where I am participating to Wikimedia+Education Conference in 
Wikimedia Movement. Before sharing my experience there here is some cntext:
...user groups and affiliates are developing Education Programs elsewhere, teachers are using wikis (and not only Wikimedia) 
as a teaching resource, students are using Wikipedia to complete their assignments... and are even doing
assignments on Wikipedia. Education community and Wikimedia movement are two sides of the same broad idea: knowledge must be 
accessible to every humankind. 
I am representing Wikimedia Community User Group in the event and will share our planns for the Wiki in Education projects we 
are already working in Albania.

I will be updating this post as the event progresses in the next days. In the mean time here are some updates on Twitter:
