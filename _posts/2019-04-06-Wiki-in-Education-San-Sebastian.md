I'm writting this blog post from [Donostia-San Sebastian (Basque Country)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10313) where I am participating to Wikimedia+Education Conference in 
Wikimedia Movement. Before sharing my experience there here is some context:
...user groups and affiliates are developing Education Programs elsewhere, teachers are using wikis (and not only Wikimedia) 
as a teaching resource, students are using Wikipedia to complete their assignments... and are even doing
assignments on Wikipedia. Education community and Wikimedia movement are two sides of the same broad idea: knowledge must be 
accessible to every humankind. 
I am representing [Wikimedia Community User Group](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Community_User_Group_Albania) in the event and will share our planns for the Wiki in Education projects we are already working on implementing in Albania.


## Traveling to San Sebastian and opening ceremony
i arrived in San San Sebastian Friday evening and managed to be just in time for the opening ceremony. The event was hosted in the town hall (current the city library) - built in 1817 and the between 1828 and 1832, which is next to the Constitution Square. 
Photos from the opening ceremony can  be found here [commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia%2BEducation_Conference_2019_opening_ceremony](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia%2BEducation_Conference_2019_opening_ceremony)

## First day of the conference

## Second Day 
Starting with a lot of rain, aparently a characteristic of the city, I continued working on the blog post and followed quite interesting sessions. 

I will be updating this post as the event progresses in the next days. In the mean time here are some updates on Twitter:
