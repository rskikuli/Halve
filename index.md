# Long Story Short

My name is Redon Skikuli and I'm currently based in [41°19′44″N 19°49′04″E](https://osm.org/go/xexSP~s?m=).

In 2012 I co-founded [Open Labs hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc) and started co-organising [Open Source Conference Albania](https://oscal.openlabs.cc), Wiki Weekend, Wiki Loves Monuments, CryptoParty Tirana, CopyFest and other initiatives related to free open source software, online privacy and the commons in the digital age. I am an active OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia and Mozilla contributor.

The last couple of years I'm co-developing [CityZen](http://cityzenapp.co/), an OSM-based city navigation mobile app & [Identihub](https://identihub.co/) the visual assets self-hosting platform, in collaboration with really talented people that trust in a decetralised future.

Currently I pay my bills as a member of [Collective68](http://collective68.tech/),  a crew of talented people that are serious when working on free open source software & hardware, open data, online privacy & security, open geoinformation and the digital public domain.  

Things I enjoy doing: spreading counterculture propaganda while throwing [kung-fu kicks](https://youtu.be/wo2aUfwPQvs?t=41s) to [nazis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFM-9liNmrM).
