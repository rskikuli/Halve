# Long Story Short

My name is Redon Skikuli and I'm currently based in 41°19′44″N 19°49′04″E. 
I'm the co-founder of [Open Labs hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc) ( from 2012) and co-organiser of [Open Source Conference Albania](https://oscal.openlabs.cc), Wiki Weekend and CopyFest. 

I'm co-developing CityZen (an OSM-based city navigation mobile app) & [Identihub](https://identihub.co/) (open source visual assets hosting) in collaboration with really talented people that trust in a decetralised future. 

I pay my bills as a visual communication & free open source solutions consultant at [Ura Design](https://ura.design/) and Collective68.
