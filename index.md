### Long Story Short
My name is Skikuli and I'm currently based in [41°19′44″N 19°49′04″E](https://osm.org/go/xexSP~s?m=).
In 2012 I co-founded [Open Labs hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc) and started co-organizing [Open Source Conference Albania](https://oscal.openlabs.cc), Wiki Weekend, Wiki Loves Monuments, CryptoParty Tirana, CopyFest and other initiatives related to free open source culture. I'm a long time active OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia contributor and a [Mozilla Tech Speaker](https://wiki.mozilla.org/TechSpeakers).

##### Proud project amoungs others (ongoing)
The last couple of years I'm co-developing [CityZen](http://cityzenapp.co/), an OSM-based city navigation mobile app & [Identihub](https://identihub.co/) the self-hosted visual assets platform.

##### Professional life
Currently I pay my bills as a member of [Collective68](http://collective68.tech/), a talented crew that deydreams of a decetralised reality.  We work on projects related to free open source software & hardware, open data, online privacy & security, open geoinformation and the digital public domain.  

##### Things I enjoy doing
City-biking, growing my [record collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3_swo25ctM) and spreading counterculture propaganda while throwing [kung-fu kicks](https://youtu.be/wo2aUfwPQvs?t=41s) to [nazis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFM-9liNmrM).
