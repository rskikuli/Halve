# Long Story Short

My name is Redon Skikuli and I'm currently based in 41°19′44″N 19°49′04″E.

In 2012 I co-founded [Open Labs hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc) and started co-organising [Open Source Conference Albania](https://oscal.openlabs.cc), Wiki Weekend, CryptoPArty Tirana, CopyFest and other initiatives related to free open source software, online privacy and the commons in the digital age.

The last couple of years I'm co-developing [CityZen](http://cityzenapp.co/), an OSM-based city navigation mobile app & [Identihub](https://identihub.co/) the visual assets self-hosting platform, in collaboration with really talented people that trust in a decetralised future. 

Currently I pay my bills as a visual communication & free open source solutions consultant at Collective68 & [Ura Design](https://ura.design/).
